data source: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

Procedures (tentative):

0. Background and purposes

1. Data Prepocessing: read data, preliminary variable selection, transfer binary variables into dummy variables

2. Data Discription: compute and plot statistics

3. Data splitting: construct training set(75%) and testing set(25%)

4. Variable selection: Lasso

5. Model selection: 

Logistics regression
                    
Clustering
                    
KNN classification
                    
PCA
                    
LDA/QDA
                    
Decision Tree
                    
Random Forest
                    
Bagging/boosting

Compute and compare prediction errors, draw ROC curve, PR curve, confusion matrix

6. Predict new X variables

7. Conclusion
